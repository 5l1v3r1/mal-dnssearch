Example files to test with. Make sure matching works!
The lists do change, in that case, your best bet is to compare
the same file which should *always* result in a match.

Note: Add -v or -V to debug.

e.g. 

# Match DNS names against malhosts.txt list
./mal-dnssearch.sh -c test/malhosts.test 

# Match IPs by comparing the same file
./mal-dnssearch.sh -z test/compromised-ips.test -0 test/compromised-ips.test

# Match IPs from Snort Labs' ip-filter list
./mal-dnssearch.sh -z test/ip-filter.test -1

# Match default list (DNS) against two log inputs
./mal-dnssearch.sh -p test/malhosts.test -d test/dns.pcap 

# Same as above but use the an alternative mal host (DNS) file
./mal-dnssearch.sh -p test/malhosts.test -s test/dns.pcap -7 -N

Note: Use -N to skip download in the case where you already have the file

# Create your own
echo -e "badwebsite.com\negativeperson.net\nevilcountry.org" > list.test
for i in $(seq 1 254); do echo 192.168.1.$i; done > list.test
